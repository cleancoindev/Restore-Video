# Restore-Video

Implementation of various film restoration techniques.

Over the course of their lifetime, films can deteriorate as a result of environmental hazards, for example chemical instabilities, humidity and dust.
The resulting defects can be remedied using a number of techniques, such as correction of global flicker, blotch reparation, correction of vertical artefacts and video stabilisation.
This algorithm, which utilises all of the above, is fully documented in `report.pdf`.
